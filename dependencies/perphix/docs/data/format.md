# Data Format

Perphix data is modeled after the COCO dataset. The images are stored en masse in a single
directory, called the `image_dir`. The annotations are stored in a single JSON file, called the
`annotation`. For a detailed description of the COCO dataset format, see [this
tutorial](https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/create-coco-annotations-from-scratch).
Here, we provide an overview of the annotations.

## Annotation Format

The annotation file is a JSON file with the following fields:

- `info`: a dictionary with information about the dataset.
- `licenses`: a list of dictionaries with information about the licenses of the images in the dataset.
- `images`: a list of dictionaries each containing information about an image in the dataset.
- `annotations`: a list of dictionaries each containing a spatial annotations of the images in the dataset, i.e. bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and keypoints.
- `categories`: a list of dictionaries with information about the categories of the images in the dataset.
- `sequences`: a list of dictionaries with information about the image sequences in the dataset.
- `seq_categories`: a list of dictionaries with information about the categories of the image sequences in the dataset.

If the dataset contains individual images, the `sequences` list will be empty.

In each dictionary, the `id` field is the unique identifier of *that* dictionary. The dictionary may also contain references to other Ids, e.g. the `image_id` field in the `annotations` dictionary refers to the `id` field in the `images` dictionary.

In detail, here are the fields of each dictionary:
